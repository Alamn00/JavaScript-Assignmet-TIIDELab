            My name is Aminu Bawa, and I'm 26 years old. I was born and  raised in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. I had the privilege of studying 
            Political Science and International Relations at the University of Abuja.
            While pursuing my academic career, I discovered my passion for  technology. I became a tech enthusiast, eager to explore the vast world of
            programming and web development. Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
            In my pursuit of knowledge and growth, I am thrilled to be a part of Tidelab's program. It has been an incredible experience so far, as I 
            am now in my sixth week of learning. Tidelab provides me with the resources and guidance to sharpen my technical skills and delve deeper 
            into the world of programming. 
            I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my journey as a developer. With each passing day, I am committed to 
            honing my skills, pushing my boundaries, and making a positive impact in the field of technology.
            I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given, and I look forward to what the future holds as I continue to learn and grow in this exciting and ever-evolving field.
